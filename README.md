About The Project

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to take turns playing the game, with a simple and intuitive interface. The game automatically detects win conditions or draw situations and provides a button to restart the game.
